``` 
         Write a register level program to calculate each
         bit address of Port F Data register, where the red,
         green, blue LEDs are connected. Also light each
         led with different delay 1 sec, 2sec, 3 sec.

         How many cycle do we need to create the delay of 1
         sec, 2 sec, and 3 sec. Read the datasheet and
         identify the clock frequency on the GPIO port.
